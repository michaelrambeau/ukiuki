## v0.0.1 2014-08-02

The very first version of UKiUKi is a simple prototype of homepage that uses KeystoneJS as a backend engine.
Galleries (pictures uploaded by the members) are created from the backend using "Cloudinary" online service to store pictures.
The top page displays a dynamic grid of pictures using 1, 2, 3 or 4 columns depending on the screen size.
